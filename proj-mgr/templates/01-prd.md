**Project Context & Traceability**

*   **Standard Document Hierarchy:** `PRD -> Architecture PoV (Arch-PoV) -> Epics -> Features -> Stories -> Tasks`
*   **Traceability Requirement:** Each subsequent document (e.g., Arch-PoV, Epic, Story) **MUST** link back to its direct parent document using the Markdown format `[Document Title](link-to-document-markdown-file)` and include relevant parent identifiers (e.g., Parent ID, Title) to ensure full context traceability down to the Task level.
*   **Hierarchical Numbering:** Items will follow a hierarchical numbering scheme based on their parent (e.g., Epic `1` may contain Features `1.1`, `1.2`; Feature `1.2` may contain Stories `1.2.1`, `1.2.2`).

_**Core Tasks/Skills:** List the specific functions the agent should perform. Use unique IDs for referencing._

| ID      | Capability                        | Description                                         | Autonomy Level                          | Related Goal(s) | Status   |
| :------ | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :------- |
| CAP-001 | [e.g., Document Summarization]    | Summarize provided text documents up to X length. | Fully Autonomous                        | GOAL-001        | Proposed |
| CAP-002 | [e.g., Meeting Scheduling]        | Schedule meetings based on user requirements.       | Requires User Confirmation (for send) | GOAL-002        | Proposed |
| CAP-003 | [e.g., Data Stream Analysis]      | Analyze predefined data streams for anomalies.    | Presents Findings Only                  | GOAL-001        | Proposed |
| CAP-004 | [e.g., FAQ Answering]             | Answer questions based on the internal KB.        | Fully Autonomous                        | GOAL-003        | Proposed |
| CAP-005 | [e.g., Process Guidance]          | Guide users through steps of Process X.           | Suggests Next Step                      | GOAL-003        | Proposed |
| ...     | ...                               | ...                                                 | ...                                     | ...             | ...      |

_**Autonomy Levels Definitions (Examples):**_
*   _**Fully Autonomous:** Agent performs the task end-to-end without intervention._
*   _**Requires User Confirmation:** Agent prepares the action but needs user approval before execution (e.g., sending an email, modifying a file)._
*   _**Presents Findings Only:** Agent performs analysis but only presents results; user decides subsequent actions._
*   _**Suggests Options/Next Step:** Agent proposes potential actions or steps, user selects._

_**Decision-Making Framework (High-Level):** Describe the key factors or rules the agent should consider when making choices (without specifying the algorithm)._
> _Example: Prioritize user-stated goals, adhere to safety guardrails (see Section 7), use provided knowledge base first, check confidence score before acting autonomously, escalate uncertainty to user if confidence < threshold._

_**Action Space:** Define the systems, tools, APIs, or environments the agent can interact with._
> _Example: Internal Knowledge Base API (Read), Calendar API (Read/Write), User Database (Read-Only), Specific third-party tool API (Write with confirmation)._

---

## 7. Behavioral Requirements & Guardrails

_**Key Use Cases/Scenarios:** Detail specific user interactions or autonomous task flows, including triggers and expected outcomes._
> _Example Scenario: User asks agent to schedule a meeting._
>   *   _Trigger: User utterance matching "schedule meeting intent"._
>   *   _Actions: Agent asks for required details (attendees, purpose, duration, timeframe). Agent checks calendars via API. Agent proposes available slots. User confirms slot. Agent sends calendar invite via API. Agent confirms success to user._
>   *   _Expected Outcome: Meeting scheduled successfully, confirmation provided._

_**Error Handling & Recovery:** How should the agent respond to failures, ambiguity, or unexpected situations? Define escalation paths if needed._
> _Example (Ambiguity): If user request is unclear, ask clarifying questions using predefined templates._
> _Example (API Failure): Inform the user the action cannot be completed currently due to a technical issue, log the error, and suggest retrying later or an alternative._

_**Safety & Ethical Guardrails:** CRITICAL. Explicitly define **what the agent must NOT do**. Specify forbidden actions, topics, data handling constraints, bias mitigation requirements._
> _Examples:_
>   *   _MUST NOT provide financial, medical, or legal advice._
>   *   _MUST NOT engage in discriminatory or offensive language._
>   *   _MUST NOT store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) beyond the scope of the immediate task._
>   *   _MUST NOT attempt to bypass user confirmation steps where defined._
>   *   _MUST NOT express personal opinions or beliefs._
>   *   _MUST adhere to bias mitigation guidelines outlined in [Link to Guidelines]._

## 15. Open Questions & Risks

*   **Open Questions:**
    *   [e.g., Final decision on handling X edge case?]
    *   [e.g., Specific data sources needed for knowledge base?]
    *   [e.g., Confirmation on the exact phrasing for critical error messages?]
*   **Risks:**
    *   [e.g., LLM API changes impacting behavior or cost.]
    *   [e.g., Difficulty achieving desired agentic consistency.]
    *   [e.g., Emergent undesirable behavior not caught by guardrails.]
