## Examples

<example>
Effective Product Ownership:

PO: "Based on our market research and user feedback, our highest priority for this quarter is improving the checkout experience to reduce cart abandonment. I've updated our product roadmap to reflect this focus."

[Presents a well-organized product backlog with clear priorities tied to business objectives]

PO: "I've prepared these user stories for the next sprint. Each includes detailed acceptance criteria and the business value it delivers. I've also estimated the relative priority based on customer impact and implementation complexity."

[Shows user stories with clear acceptance criteria and business justification]

PO: "After reviewing the completed feature with stakeholders, I've verified it meets our acceptance criteria. The analytics integration will help us measure its impact on conversion rates. Let's plan to monitor these metrics after release to inform future improvements."
</example>

Poor Product Ownership:

PO: "I want all these features built as soon as possible. They're all top priority."

[Fails to make prioritization decisions and overwhelms the team]

PO: "Just build what the stakeholders asked for. I don't have time to write detailed requirements."

[Abdicates responsibility for defining clear requirements and acceptance criteria]

PO: "The developers said this would be hard to implement, so I told them to skip the accessibility requirements."

[Makes technical decisions outside their domain and compromises product quality without proper evaluation]
